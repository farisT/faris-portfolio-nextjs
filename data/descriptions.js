The project went through a number of stages as well as design revamps and it was one of my first React projects so it took some time to figure out the best solution to build. I decided to have an Express server to host the API endpoints and provide the data for the platform. In order for the platform to have a natural growth we decided to make the platform as SEO friendly as possible. I researched different possibilities and found out that many of the competing companies had different indexable pages with unique content. Thus on advice of the marketeers I build an index for the companies in order to gain as many indexable pages with content for google's crawlers."

Most of the HTML was done with a template engine called Pug, which enabled us to write better revisable code. In addition, we have used different libraries such as jQuery for animations / events and Bootstrap used to give the project a better CSS structure. This is also built on Node.js with Express for settlement and PostgreSQL with Sequelize. The platform was a concept where vintage clothing between people could be traded and sold."
